Hello {{ username }}.

By now, you probably know that NetrunnerDB is closed. To be sure you didn't lose all your decks, I packed them all in a zip archive and here they are, ready to be imported in your next deckbuilder.

I still don't know exactly why Fantasy Flight Games, the game publisher, asked me to shut down NetrunnerDB. But there are rumours that FFG is preparing an Acceptable Use Policy to clarify what fan sites are allowed to do. If that is the case, depending on the terms of that licence, I may be able to re-open NetrunnerDB.

Until then,
Make every click count!
